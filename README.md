# CitiBike-Demand-Prediction
An End-to-End Machine Learning project where I predict demand of bikes at citibike stations at hourly level.

## Objective
Accurately predict the demand of bikes on 
1. A specific date and time of day and
1. A specific bike station

Here, the demand is defined as the following
1. **Bike Demand**: Number of bikes that will be taken from this station to go to another station
1. **Docking Demand**: Number of bikes that will come to this station to dock.

## Technologies Used
1. **PySpark** and **DeltaLake** to manage data ingestion and transformation
1. **MLFlow** for model development
1. **Flask** to create front end
1. **Git** and **GitHub** for project management
1. **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD
1. **PyTest** for writing tests
